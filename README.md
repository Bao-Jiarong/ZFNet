### Requirement
```
python==3.7.0
numpy==1.18.1
```
### How to use
Training & Prediction can be run as follows:    
`python train.py train`  
`python train.py predict img.png`  


### More information
* Please refer to the original paper of ZFNet [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/paper-review-of-zfnet-the-winner-of-ilsvlc-2013-image-classification-d1a5a0c45103) for more information.

### Implementation Notes
* **Note 1**:   
Since datasets are somehow huge and painfully slow in training ,I decided to make number of filters variable. If you want to run it in your PC, you can reduce the number of filters into 32,16,8,4 or 2. (64 is by default). For example:  
`model = zfnet.ZFNet((113, 113, 3), classes = 10, filters = 8)`

* **Note 2** :   
You can also make the size of images smaller, so that it can be ran faster and doesn't take too much memories.

### Result for MNIST:   
* Learning rate = 0.0001  
* Batch size = 32  
* Optimizer = Adam   
* Filters = 8
* epochs = 2
